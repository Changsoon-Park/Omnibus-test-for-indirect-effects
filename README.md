The three files are R-codes for the omnibus test of indirect effects between multiple groups. These groups are formed based on three different cases: 
an antecedent variable, a moderator in the first stage, and a moderator in the second stage of the mediation path. Hayes' (2022) example data are used for illustration.
The file 'Example PROTEST categorical X.R' provides the R-code for the omnibus test of indirect effects between groups, formed by a multi-categorical antecedent variable.
The file 'Example DISASTER 1st stage moderation.R' containes the R-code for the omnibus test of indirect effects between groups, formed by first stage moderation with a multi-categorical moderator.
The file 'Example TEAMS 2nd stage moderation.R' containes the R-code for the omnibus test of indirect effects between groups, formed by second stage moderation with a multi-categorical moderator.
